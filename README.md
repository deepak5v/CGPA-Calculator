# CGPA-Calculator
The CGPA Calculator, programmed in C++, computes a student's Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) based on input including course grades and credits. It displays individual course grades, calculates total credits and grade points, and determines the semester GPA. This tool efficiently generates and presents students' overall course grades.
